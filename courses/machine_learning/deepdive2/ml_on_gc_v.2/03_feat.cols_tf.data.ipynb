In a subsequent lab, we will use [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to define the model.\n"

When working with a small dataset like this one, we recommend using a decision tree or random forest as a strong baseline. The goal of this tutorial is not to train an accurate model, but to demonstrate the mechanics of working with structured data, so you have code to use as a starting point when working with your own datasets in the future."

We suggest finding another dataset to work with, and training a model to classify it using code similar to the above.
